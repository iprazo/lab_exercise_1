            <h2>Favorite CMSC Subject so far..</h2>
            <p> My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22 because I like object-oriented programming
                and its how most games I play were made. My little background in game development made
                the subject easier for me to understand. In the latter exercises of that subject, we were
                tasked to implement a game with GUI and that was delightfully unforgettable.

            <h2>Favorite GE so far..</h2>
            <p>As I'm only a sophomore student with no GEs this academic year, there's only 2 GEs I fully experienced 
                and my favorite is Ethics mainly because the professor had a pleasant way of teaching it (not reliant on resource reading).
                His discussions, activities, and assessments were fun and meaningful thus I learned many insights that imrpoved my decision-making in life.

            <h2>Favorite Programming Language so far..</h2>
            <p>From my fondness of object-oriented programming, my favoite programming language so far is Python. In addition, it's by far the most
                beginner-friendly language I encountered and it made my journey to the world of programming easier.
